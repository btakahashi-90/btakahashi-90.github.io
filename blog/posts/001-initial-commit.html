            <h1>Devlog Day 0 – We're Doing the Gosh Darn Thing</h1>
            <p><em>Posted: July 27, 2025</em></p>

            <p>
            IDK what I'm doing here...the "game" works, the blog posts are up (but manually added and written). YOU KNOW WHAT I NEED...to build a static site generator. It'd be pretty easy too.<br>
            Okay, maybe that'll be "next". Well...realistically what it'll be is one of my other projects (cover letter modifier) turned INTO a static site generator.<br>
            Because why reinvent the wheel. All it does is setup the "externals" then replace some text with whatever you want.<br>
            Then after that I REALLY need to write some JS to update the blog list automatically. That'll be more difficult.<br>
            But we'll cross that bridge when we get there. Because that's just how things go. Especially when you're just haphazardly swinging at the wall hoping for the best.<br>
            Fun fact, I'm writing this entirely in NVIM just try and "get good" which is failing horrible. The number of times I've had to recover a file I closed without saving, or ctrl-z'd to undo and killed nvim causing a toasted swap file and struggled to recover it is "emberassing" in a way only those who have gone through it can truly understand. That said, I'ma keep doing it because it's way more entertaining than being yelled at by an IDE that things my naming conventions are bad (note: they are, but get TF over it...it's a personal project).<br>
            <br>
            For those of you that are like "oh isn't this supposed to be a semi-professional portfolio to help you get a job" to that I say..."meh". I mean on one hand, yes, and it should be fairly stable and function as intended. On the other hand its mine and it's not going to be snatched up by some "big boy company" and refactored (I'm so...so sorry if it ever is...)<br>
            So while it's a "snapshot", its not my best work. I'll put my best foot forward for a company that's worth its salt and deserves my time. A semi-cursed dev blog, idle game worthy of more cringe than most reddit posts and project updates on silly projects isn't the place to make everything perfect.<br>
            Until then. #stillpoopen
