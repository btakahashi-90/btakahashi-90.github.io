            Yeah so hi, welcome to another dev blog where I did a thing. I uhh...applied for a job. Like a big boy job. A real job. Here's the thing...<br>
            If you're here from that job (you know who you are) and you're exploring my github, Hi. Welcome. Hope you're enjoying your stay.<br>
            While I was busy stressing over post application nonsense, torn between being excited and dreading that my public work isn't good enough I realized something...I am severly underprepared for a real job application.<br>
            I'm qualified (in my opinion...) but my "public works" don't show that because when I'm working on my own projects I honestly just want to vibe. I don't expect anyone else to come in swinging on my work and try to add to it. That's nuts.
            If someone wants to come in and "use" parts of my work for their projects, cool. Grab what you want, make your own commits and commit messages. But for me...my own messages on my own stuff, I thrive in the "you know what you did" mentality.<br>
            That is to say I know it sounds/looks lazy. I get that its not the "industry standard" but like...why would I? I'm writing these things for myself, not for some company or business. Then "how will they know how good you are" look...Real talk. 
            Stick with me here, try to keep up.<br><br>
            Most 👏 commit 👏 messaging 👏 is 👏 common 👏 sense<br>
            or sometimes even company/team tuned. "Describe what you changed" like wtf mate? That's SO VAGUE. If you really wana know what I changed you go look at the diff or rollback your own repo. Until then, know that:<br>
            Bug 22349 resolved through files A, B and C<br>
            is okay and NOT THAT HARD TO COME UP WITH. It's not...usually not...rocket science. If you don't like it, fight me (ง'̀-'́)ง (don't really, I don't know you, live your life how you want.)<br>
